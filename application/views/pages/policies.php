								</div>

									• Accessibility and Publication Standards<br>
									• Publication Ethics<br>
									• Plagiarism/Duplicate Publication<br>
									• Citation Manipulation<br>
									• Conflicts of Interest<br>
									• Copyright<br>
									• Open access policies<br>
									• Pricing policy<br>
									• Peer-review policy<br>
									• Article Withdrawal &amp; Retraction<br>
									• Reprints</p>
									<p><strong>Accessibility and Publication Standards:</strong><br>
										Avens strictly follows the publication principles of Creative Commons Attribution License under which all the published data is fully and freely accessible to all the readers. This commitment of Avens has lead to the customer satisfaction and increased readership.</p>
										<p>We provide a wide range of quality publications and standards that encourage authors’ interest, make the exchange of knowledge and information possible with the highest quality and the greatest impact. We encourage our authors to provide accessible content and offer them sufficient space to publish their content. Published articles are provided with appropriate links to all the supplements and permanent access through online.</p>
										<p><strong>Publication Ethics:</strong><br>
											The publication of an article in a peer-reviewed journal depends upon the quality of the work of the authors and the institutions that support them. Peer-reviewed articles support scientific methods and therefore it is crucial to follow the ethical behavior for all the authors, journal editors, publisher, peer-reviewers and the public involved in the publishing act.</p>
											<p>The editorial policies concerning ethics of publication of research in Avens journals includes authorship, duplicate publication, plagiarism, digital image manipulation, competing financial interests, confidentiality and pre-publicity. We follow COPE guidelines to ensure these aspects and maintain high standards for our journals’ publications.</p>
											<p>Bioethics: Manuscripts involving animals and human studies must include a statement identifying the institutional and/or licensing committee approving the experiments, including any relevant details. Authors should confirm that all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. </p>
											<p><strong>Plagiarism/Duplicate Publication:</strong><br>
												Plagiarism occurs when an author(s) intentionally copy someone else work and claim it as their own, or when author(s) duplicate their own published material. Avens journals are committed to publish only original material which is not published or under review elsewhere. </p>
												<p>Avens Publishing Group as a participant of CrossCheck uses the <a href="http://www.ithenticate.com/">iThenticate</a> software to detect instances of overlapping and similar text in submitted manuscripts. Manuscripts that are found to have been plagiarized or duplicated will be rejected immediately.</p>
												<p><strong>Citation Manipulation:</strong><br>
													Citation manipulation sanctions will be incurred when articles that are found to include citations whose primary purpose is of increasing citation rates and the journal impact factor to a given author’s work, or to articles published in a particular journal. Excessive citation may also fall under citation manipulation.</p>
													<p><strong>Conflicts of Interest:</strong><br>
														Authors at the time of submission are required to disclose any potential conflict of interest including any financial, personal or other relationships that could influence their work. The corresponding author is solely responsible for collecting the list of potential conflicts of interest from all co-authors and it is required to include it during the manuscript submission.</p>
														<p><strong>Copyright:</strong><br>
															Submission of a manuscript implies that the work described has not been published before (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture, or thesis) and that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.</p>
															<p>All works published by Avens Publishers are under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License. This permits anyone to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt the work provided the original work and source is appropriately cited.</p>
															<p><strong>Open Access Policy: </strong><br>
																Open Access articles are funded by payments that are made by authors or their institutions or funding sources. These articles are universally and freely available online to the readers without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. </p>
																<p><strong>Pricing Policy:</strong><br>
																	All the articles which are published under an Open Access policy are permanently free to be read by everyone. These articles require an Article Publishing Charge (APC) to be paid either by the author or by their institution or funder which covers the editorial and peer-review services, website hosting and administrative costs.</p>
																	<p>Authors are asked to pay the publication charges only after the acceptance of the article for its publication and articles will be made online only after the payment of publication cost. </p>
																	<p>Publication charges can be waived in genuine cases when an author would like to publish his/her article under open access policy, but cannot afford the APC. Waiver policy is applicable only upon the request of authors and priority will be given to the requests by authors from the low-income countries as per the World Bank classification. </p>
																	<p><strong>Peer-Review Policy:</strong><br>
																		All submitted manuscripts to Avens journals follow single blinded peer-review processing where the information of the reviewers is hidden from the authors. </p>
																		<p>Once a manuscript is submitted, it is assigned to one of the eminent Editorial Board members to check the genuinity, novelty and quality of research. The manuscript is evaluated by the respective editor within two days of submission. If the manuscript meets the standards of Avens, further proceeding of the manuscript is carried out. The status of acceptance/rejection will be intimated by the editorial office.</p>
																		<p>The accepted manuscripts are peer reviewed by the experts assigned by the editor. The time for peer review processing is 14 days. The comments given by the reviewer decides the fate of article towards the possible publication. If at least two reviewers support and ensure the quality and recommend for the publication, the article is processed and published without any changes with editor’s approval.</p>
																		<p>If the reviewer suggest for the revision (minor/major) the corresponding author will be notified to make the desirable changes in the manuscript towards publication.</p>
																		<p>The manuscript will be rejected if more than two reviewers express their disapproval towards the publication. However, the editor approval is mandatory for the publication at any stage. Avens is committed to its 60 day rapid publication process.</p>
																		<p><strong>Article Withdrawal &amp; Retraction:</strong><br>
																			Retraction of an article involves signing a retraction specifying the error by the author and all co-authors. Authors must state briefly how the conclusions are affected, and submit it for publication. If any co-authors are unwilling and disagree for this, editors may seek advice from independent peer-reviewers and impose the type of amendment that seems most appropriate for it. </p>
																			<p>Articles which are accepted for publication but which have not been formally published will be added in “Articles in Press”. These articles sometimes include errors, or are discovered to be accidental duplicates of other published article(s), or are determined to violate Avens publication ethics guidelines in the view of the editors, may be “Withdrawn” and the content of the article (HTML and PDF) is removed.</p>
